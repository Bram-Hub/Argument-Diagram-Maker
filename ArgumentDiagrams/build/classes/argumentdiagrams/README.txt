Notes about the current version of the program:

-Is known to work on windows and mac, but appears to have issues with linux due to JavaFX not being part of default Java.
(I was unable to find a fix, but I am not well versed in linux)

- save files have the extension .admf

To Any Potential Future Programmers:
-This was written using the default version of Java at the time, and the only known additional library is JavaFX for the GUI
-My focus while making this was on completion of a usable program, not necessarily on well documented code. Sorry for any inconvenience this causes.
